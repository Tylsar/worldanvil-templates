                  the spell is successfully cast and you do not forget the spell—you

                  * You draw unwelcome attention or put yourself in a spot. The GM will tell you how.
                  * The spell disturbs the fabric of reality as it is cast—take -1 ongoing to cast
                   a spell until the next time you Prepare Spells.
                  * After it is cast, the spell is forgotten. You cannot cast the spell again until
                  you prepare spells.

                  Note that maintaining spells with ongoing effects will sometimes
                  cause a penalty to your roll to cast a spell."
